## Installation

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/unhappychoice/gitlogue.git
cd gitlogue
cargo install --path .
```

### Using Cargo

```bash
cargo install gitlogue
```

## Usage

### Screensaver Mode (Random Commits)

Navigate to a Git repository and run:

```bash
gitlogue
```

This will randomly select commits and replay them with animations.

### View a Specific Commit

```bash
gitlogue --commit <commit-hash>
```

### Options

- `--commit <hash>` - Display a specific commit instead of random playback
- `--theme <name>` - Select a theme (e.g., dracula, nord, monokai)
- `--speed <ms>` - Set typing speed in milliseconds per character (default: 30)
- `--help` - Show help information

### Commands

- `theme list` - List all available themes

### Themes

gitlogue supports multiple themes. Use `theme list` subcommand to see all available options:

```bash
gitlogue theme list
```

Select a theme with the `--theme` option:

```bash
gitlogue --theme dracula
gitlogue --theme nord
gitlogue --theme solarized-light
```

You can also set a default theme in `~/.config/gitlogue/config.toml`:

```toml
theme = "dracula"
```

See [docs/themes.md](docs/themes.md) for more information about themes and customization.

### Controls

- `Esc` or `Ctrl+C` - Quit the application

## How It Works

gitlogue reads your Git repository history and recreates the development experience:

1. Selects commits from your repository (randomly or specified)
2. Analyzes file changes and diffs
3. Uses tree-sitter for syntax highlighting
4. Animates the typing of code changes line by line
5. Displays file trees, metadata, and commit information

## Development

### Requirements

- Rust 1.70 or later
- Git

### Building

```bash
cargo build --release
```

### Running Tests

```bash
cargo test
```

### Running Examples

```bash
cargo run --example test_highlighter
```
